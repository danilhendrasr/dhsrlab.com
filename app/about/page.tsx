              I&apos;m a muslim and a software engineer based in Sidoarjo,
              Indonesia. Currently a full-stack engineer in a South
              Tangerang-based consulting company.
            </p>
            <p className="w-5/6">
              I&apos;m a computer science graduate from Universitas Pembangunan
              Nasional &quot;Veteran&quot; Jawa Timur. I&apos;ve been in touch
              with programming since high-school, mostly through web-development
              (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and stuff). I&apos;ve graduated in 2023 with
              3.9/4 GPA. Have done several internships as a student and have
              been working as a full-stack engineer since 1 year before
              graduation.
            </p>
            <p className="w-5/6">
              Now I&apos;m meddling around with technologies like React,
              TypeScript, and Go. I&apos;m interested in learning more about the
              cloud-native way, and would love the chance to work with Rust
              full-time.
            </p>
            <p className="w-5/6">
              I&apos;m a guy with lots of interests, so aside of programming I
              also do stuff like:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-disc text-sm px-3">
              <li>
                Sports (football, badminton, weightlifting, running, hiking, and
                combat sports).
              </li>
              <li>
                Taking pictures (albeit I&apos;m not really good at it :p)
              </li>
              <li>
                Reading non-technical books (novels, religions, history,
                politics, financial, just anything other than comics)
              </li>
              <li>Writing (I write poems sometimes by the way)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              So feel free to talk to me about those if you happen to have the
              same interest! :D
            </p>
