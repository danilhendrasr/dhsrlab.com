        <p class="font-semibold">
          I'm Danil Hendra Suryawan. You can call me Danil.
        </p>
        <div class="text-[#425466] flex flex-col gap-5">
          <p class="w-5/6">
            I'm a muslim and a software engineer based in Sidoarjo, Indonesia.
            Currently a full-stack engineer in a South Tangerang-based
            consulting company.
          </p>
          <p class="w-5/6">
            I'm a computer science graduate from Universitas Pembangunan
            Nasional "Veteran" Jawa Timur. I've been in touch with programming
            since high-school, mostly through web-development (HTML, CSS, JS,
            PHP and stuff). I've graduated in 2023 with 3.9/4 GPA. Have done
            several internships as a student and have been working as a
            full-stack engineer since 1 year before graduation.
          </p>
          <p class="w-5/6">
            Now I'm meddling around with technologies like React, TypeScript,
            and Go. I'm interested in learning more about the cloud-native way,
            and would love the chance to work with Rust full-time.
          </p>
          <p class="w-5/6">
            I'm a guy with lots of interests, so aside of programming I also do
            stuff like:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-disc text-sm px-3">
            <li>
              Sports (football, badminton, weightlifting, running, hiking, and
              combat sports).
            </li>
            <li>Taking pictures (albeit I'm not really good at it :p)</li>
            <li>
              Reading non-technical books (novels, religions, history, politics,
              financial, just anything other than comics)
            </li>
            <li>Writing (I write poems sometimes by the way)</li>
            <li>If not for my religion, I'd probably do music too</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            So feel free to talk to me about those if you happen to have the
            same interest! :D
          </p>
